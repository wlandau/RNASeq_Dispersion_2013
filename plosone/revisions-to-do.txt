1. Compare with similar studies by Wu et al. and Yu et al.
2. Why Anders and Huber normalization? Or, how does normalization affect dispersion estimation and tests for differential expression?
3. Address reasons for "systematic biases" in Figure 4 and their implications.
4. Explain how to construct an ROC curve in more detail.
5. Explain small AUC values.
6. Explain why AUCs are all the same for the QL test.
7. Explain why the Trended APL and Tagwise APL methods have similar MSE but different AUC.
